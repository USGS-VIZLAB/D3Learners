jzwart,data science,Provide access to and analysis of water quantity and quality for the United States historically and in the future. Forecasting is important for decision making Increase public understanding of water quantity / quality issues 
mbucknell,decision support,Provide modern web services that provide data to scientists. Provide modern web pages that communicate our science to the general public and policy makers. Web pages should be continually involving as we apply user experience lessons and new technologies.
lcarr,data science,"I2D2 is a vehicle for turning data and science into information and decisions. Our role can include doing this process ourselves, as well as providing guidance and assistance to the rest of the boxes. Keep in mind that the boxes aren't a pipeline where all products from the previous boxes are filtered through our division. That is one example of how they relate but we do not hold the key to releasing information. We need to give others the tools to ""disseminate"" their science. Our value is to make sure our science products are used and seen by our audiences. "
bneff,decision support,"[Neff] I can provide robust detail on the big picture that frames my suggestion. Also, you could just watch my presentation from Wednesday and more or less get up to speed on my thinking. Essentially, I define our problem as a need to close the gap between scientific knowledge and its useful application. Brian's vision Statement: To close the gap between USGS/WMA science and its benefit to society. Brian's Mission Statement: (macro scale description of what we need to do and what we value) The IIDD serves the taxpayer by enabling better use of WMA/USGS Science by communicating our science in ways that are relevant, accessible, and understandable to our audiences. We value fair compensation, professional freedom, training, respect for diversity, and a healthy, creative work environment."
appling,data science,"Support the transparent, efficient, and effective flow of information from data collection to public use and understanding. We identify and engineer highly effective formats for data dissemination and use. We transform scientific insights and raw data into information products with strong relevance to public understanding, management, policy, and disaster response. Scientific technicians and researchers within the USGS WMA; the public, managers, and policymakers beyond. Enhance the recognized value of USGS information products by maximizing their accessibility and relevance. Hone the cost effectiveness of USGS information production by identifying opportunities for increased efficiency in the preparation and quality control of those products. WMA's information products are more discoverable and more highly used than ever before. Data collection and data analysis in the Water Science Centers and/or headquarters Divisions leverage computational tools more extensively and are consequently more efficient. We have played a role in translating numerous scientific insights from local to national scales and from research to application emphases. WSCs and the other headquarters Divisions know our offerings and make more requests for collaboration than we can satisfy, and we have a system for identifying and allocating our resources to the highest-priority ideas."
DS_background,data science,"Challenges associated with the volume, variety, and complexity of modern environmental data should not limit USGS’s ability to answer societally-relevant questions in a timely manner. Science practices can be constrained by limited access to appropriate technical skills and computing power, and therefore a need exists to cultivate new skills and provide training opportunities for our evolving workforce. The deluge of data resulting from the intersection of ubiquitous sensing and modeling activities (referred to as “Big Data”) has created new challenges and opportunities for environmental science.  The tools to extract understanding from big data can be applied both to water science needs, i.e., to generating water resources insights with unprecedented speed and public relevance, and to operational needs, i.e., to assessing and refining WMA's processes of data collection, quality assurance, analysis, and dissemination. Extracting insight from Big Data and moving data-driven science from description to prediction will require new collaborations between technologists and domain researchers. By working with water science practitioners, WMA data scientists can help USGS tackle water resources and operational questions that are analytically complex and computationally challenging, broad or highly resolved in space and time, and diverse in the type or structure of supporting data. These challenges are met by automating the transformation of raw data into final products, adopting best practices for code collaboration and organization, and using high-throughput or high-performance computing to concentrate researchers' time on science over implementation."
DS_goals,data science,Strengthen workforce capability in scientific computing. Distill Big Data into useful insight. Build efficiency through reproducible and collaborative workflows
DS_activities,data science,"Scientific computing workforce development. Formal training in scientific computing and other data science skills (e.g., reproducible workflows; automated reporting). Support skill-building that results in new or saved program dollars for the field. Defining and delivering new insights and metrics. Apply data-driven analysis and prediction techniques, including machine learning and anomaly detection. Define metrics, derivatives, or visuals that distill large volumes or complex data into useful information. Generate insights relevant to outward-facing science and internal operations. Draw on national-to-global datasets and models to contextualize current events and inform stakeholder decisions; translate WMA web analytics and operations data into actionable information. Strengthening data analysis workflows. Enable and develop reproducible and transparent data-driven science practices. Scale analyses to larger regions or finer detail through automation, scalable algorithms, and distributed computing. Collaborate on the challenges of data integration and data-model fusion faced by research projects."
DSB_vision,decision support,"To enhance and increase the use of USGS science and information in water resource management, extreme event preparedness and response, and policy development. To serve the taxpayer by enabling water managers to make better science-based decisions and helping USGS incorporate water management issues into its science. We value fair compensation, professional freedom, training, respect for diversity, and a healthy, creative work environment. Topics of primary interest are water resource management, extreme event preparedness and response, and policy development. Decision makers of primary interest are water managers, emergency managers, policy makers, and, when appropriate, politicians."

DSB_activities,decision support,"Build partnerships within WMA, across Mission Areas, across federal agencies, and partners like Red Cross, TNC. Support USGS scientists and project managers understand and incorporate decision making needs in their projects. Contextualize and deliver information relevant to flood response. Convert raw streamflow & weather data to information that is relevant to a local response plan and integrated with the portfolio of information used to guide the flood response. For example, when stream stage is forecasted to increase to X, there could be an automated alert to trigger response Y from agencies a, b, c. Delivered to geographically relevant area via text message, websites, etc. Establish and utilize a physical presence on resource management committees, councils, groups, etc. to help decision makers understand the full value of USGS science and products to the decision at hand. Develop and utilize a meaningful presence in the water policy development community to perceive, understand, and anticipate decision-making issues and information needs. Develop and implement a suite of approaches to sensitize USGS scientists and project managers to the value of incorporating decision-making information needs into WMA projects.
